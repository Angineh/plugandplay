Finally when they do connect the broker sends the business owner some PDF document that the business owner has to fill in and mail back with a wet signature and a signed check. Assuming the business owner is able to fill in the PDF on their own without needing to contact the broker again this process ends up taking 2 to 3 weeks before the business owner is insured. In the mean time they can\'t start their business or if they do start it they are at risk for serious liabilities.

He served on the boards of two brokers before joining AIG and moving to Spain and Gibraltar where he set up the Gibraltar branches of Alico and Eurinvest (life and mutual fund subsidiaries of AIG). In 1990, Nigel was appointed, by the British Foreign Office, as the first insurance regulator of the British Virgin Islands. He served in that position for just over four years during which time he steered the Insurance Act through the legislature and set up the regulatory department which has since evolved into the Financial Services Commission. Nigel also served on the steering committee that formed the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and was elected to its first Executive Committee by the insurance regulators of other countries. He also chaired the IAIS committee on exchange of information. He joined forces with a B.V.I. trust company in 1995 and formed a jointly owned captive manager which, by the time he left, was the largest in the B.V.I. Nigel set up his own company in 2000 and has run his own business ever since. He was engaged by a division of the UN to train regulators in another country and has served on the board of many captives, the largest of which had assets in excess of $500 million. He is currently an owner/manager of Three Saints Management, LLC which is a licensed ‘Support Business’ (the term for an insurance management company in the US Virgin Islands) and also manages captives for clients in the US and Jamaica.\n','May-16','','ShareTempus is the ideal solution for a wide variety of platforms not only in the sharing scene, but also across the wider app economy. Any marketplace that wants to increase trust in user transactions, a sector growing rapidly with the simplicity technology offers to secondhand item exchange, can leverage our API to offer protection across their platform. In the sharing economy, studies by Price Waterhouse Coopers and the Pew Center have demonstrated the immense market size (118M users) and the high number of US consumers that have participated in this new economy. However, the studies also show that trust in these transactions is a concern. ShareTempus is positioning to provide trust for these transactions through our patent-pending products, our automated API and our Sharing Protection Plans (SPP). Through these products, app economy marketplaces could easily integrate protection into their platform, much like Stripe is used for credit card transactions. \nShareTempus has approached numerous sharing platforms that are eager for such a trust infrastructure solution. For example, PartiO, a college sharing app used by students at Duke and Yale, hit a ceiling in user transactions as students would become reluctant to share/rent items of dollar values over $150. There was immense concern about the loss or damage for high value items. This limitation caused challenge on both sides of the market - renters worried about damaging items and incurring associated repair costs, while owners hesitated felt they couldn’t trust the platform and its users. PartiO attempted to find a solution internally, thinking to set aside a fund for guaranteeing transactions. In the end, the associated legal requirements were too challenging, the risk of marketing fallout too high, and the cost of hiring personnel to handle and process claims too expensive. There was no easy solution to protect the owner and renter. After ShareTempus contacted PartiO, a partnership was immediately desirable. PartiO desired to pay ShareTempus a set monthly fee per user, and in exchange, ShareTempus would offer protection on all platform transactions, with claims capped at a maximum user payout. In beta testing, the solution has worked extremely well for PartiO. ShareTempus has easily integrated into the PartiO flow, and has allowed PartiO to claim complete protection for their users. As a result, users have been much more willing to add high value items to the platform. Thus far, no significant claims (<$50) have been made in the PartiO beta testing. ','For the right insurance partner that backs our start-up, they will have an opportunity to expose their brand to a new generation of customers. The App Economy is heavily used by a younger demographic and ShareTempus, as a market leader in the App Economy, can be the FIRST exposure these users have to an insurance company.','Insurance Marketplaces Sharing Economy API SaaS App Economy, Sharing economy and online marketplaces Machine Learning AI ','',NULL,0,NULL),(10,'10/12/2016 21:45','Biovirtua','Biovirtua is bridging the worldwide gap of medical specialists with holographic patient-provider visits.

Filter subscription services (many, including Amazon) offer an incremental improvement to the time-based replacement model.  ','Our advantages over the direct competitors are cost, ease of use, and scalability.  We use Bluetooth beacon technology to carry a small data payload that represents the health of the HVAC system.  In its simplest use case, AirPulse uses Bluetooth in a Physical Web / Progressive Web App implementation.  This frictionless connection schema removes a major adoption barrier intrinsic to other systems and enables users to derive immediate value within seconds of installation.  We also send more complex data sets by Bluetooth to Breezi\'s cloud analytics platform.   In our cloud the data is transformed into rich information to predict failures of HVAC systems before they occur.  This information is available via web and native mobile apps that enable seamless connection to service providers to help resolve problems.\n\nAs for the indirect competition, our advantages are even more obvious since competitive products are based on changing air filters on some arbitrary time schedule.  This is like a person trying to stay healthy by crash dieting and exercising only 3-4 times a year.  AirPulse\'s most straightforward benefit is that it tells you when to change the filter based on its actual condition, so your HVAC can breathe as it was designed rather than gasping for air as the filter starts to clog.  Gasping and sucking HVAC systems use a lot more energy and cause unnecessary damage to expensive components like blowers, coils, and compressors.  AirPulse and our Breezi cloud can identify these bigger problems as well and then connect you to trusted experts when the problem needs attention.\n\nWe have filed for a utility patent that covers the technology used in AirPulse and the related services and condition-based advertisements it enables.

The clinician prescribes every patient the same drug first, usually a diuretic. It’s titrated up to the maximum tolerable dose and if it doesn’t work, a second drug is added; typically a vasodilator. Same process and finally a third drug is added; a beta blocker.  No drugs are removed. This process takes an average of fifteen months and at least four office visits. Many abandon their therapy because this approach is very painstaking, particularly for a disease without symptoms. Even for therapy-compliant patients this doesn’t work: 40% of those taking medications as prescribed, don\'t have it under control.\n\nCurrent antihypertensive therapy is typically based on the JNC-8 guidelines where the first line of therapy is initiated based on clinical characteristics of the population, rather than for the genetic make-up of the individual. For example, only ~30% of the population is salt-sensitive and only 50% of patients respond to a diuretic, but this remains the first drug, on average, for high BP according to JNC-8 guidelines. The delay in optimal treatment for BP due to the generalized approach to BP therapy is likely one reason for the fact that only half of hypertensive patients in the United States have their high BP under control. In fact, 40% of patients wo are compliant with their BP therapy do not have their BP under control, suggesting that they are on the wrong pharmacotherapy. Mechanistic hypertension can be caused by elevated cardiac output, vascular dysfunction, or hyperabsorption of Na+ in the kidneys.

','Sutro’s CEO, Ravi Kurani, grew up working in swimming-pool stores and helped his family business transition from a brick and mortar store to an online distributor of pool supplies. Ravi saw, first hand, the pool maintenance issues his customers complained about often. Having worked with IoT before it was IoT, co-founder Andrew Redfern brings a fresh perspective to the pool industry. Andrew has over a decade of experience in the prototyping, design, and manufacture of networked hardware. An expert with embedded software, he was the first hire at Sentilla, a wireless sensor network and data analytics company acquired by Ericsson in 2014.','10/1/2014','','Sutro’s sensor has the ability to measure water chemistry with applications such as swimming pools, precision agriculture, and municipalities. Currently, we are building pilots for three strategics; Amazon, Zodiac, and Veolia. Zodiac approached Sutro with the need to create an in-line / in-pipe sensor to measure swimming pool water quality. ','Swimming pools are a pain. Owners need to understand basic chemistry and math, and pools and spas need to be tested at least once a week. If an owner forgets to test, they face up to $200 - $400 in chemical costs and more than a week’s worth of time in removing and filtering algae. 12% of US homes have a pool or spa in their backyard, and interestingly enough, these 15 million consumers have a higher disposable income than most. Over $10 billion is spent on chemicals in the residential pool industry, and the current technology in the pool and spa space hasn’t changed for over 75 years. \n\n\n85% of the 15 million pool and spa owners manually measure water chemistry via colorimetric test kits and litmus test strips. Not only are there inherent errors in the manual testing process, but the user has to remember to test regularly. The biggest issue is in the post-processing of the tested data, i.e. taking the tested values and then computing amounts of chemicals needed to dose.\n\n\nSutro has developed a suite of proprietary sensors to measure multiple water chemistry vectors, modeled from technology in the medical industry. The drop-in, floating device communicates to the companion app, enabling Sutro to prescribe and sell chemicals and tap into the $10 billion market. Furthermore, we can leapfrog into international pool markets and other commercial industries that utilize water, such as industrial fisheries, and post-harvest agricultural water monitoring. \n\n\nSutro is a subscription-free model that is a pool store in their pocket. Customers normally visit pool stores in peak summer months with water samples, to understand their water chemistry before the next big pool party. However, as people are not migrating way from brick and mortar pool stores with online shopping, the service and experience that used to be had at a pool store is now lost. As we have insider knowledge from the pool industry, we’re bridging this gap with our UX that brings a very similar experience to what you had at the pool store, in the palm of your hand. Sutro helps customers understand their water chemistry and tells them what to do without automatically selling them something.

In the past, our pilots were with our recommendation API, but we find that our temporal API is more interesting. \n\nWe do this via a couple option.\n1. Enrich Temporal Data\nWe can enrich your user data set with temporal data (weather, holiday, region-specific events, and timezone) which can be utilized for profiling or other analytics/intelligence use cases. This is usually a great pilot example for showing coverage as well as seeing the quality of the structured data. We provide the temporal data and interests inferred from social footprints (this interest/intent is more generalized)\n\n2. Extract Temporal Patterns\nIf you already have a predictive project, we can also extract temporal patterns from your existing data such as past browsing, purchase history, or interaction user activities which can be weighted and fed into your predictive project. You will have the configurable option to include temporal data or just your own raw data sources. You can include as many or as little data sources. An example would be if you have consumer app data and a partner site where you collect interaction data from. You can just share consumer app data and/or both types of data irregardless of if they are stored in different internal DBs.\n\n3. The Full Intent Detection and User Profiling\nWe can also determine the full intent and user profiling where we handle the full prediction. This means that we will map and format the structured data in the format you will consume the detection and profiling. We will need to understand how you are utilizing this data so that we can make suggestions on the best place for integration.

As a grad student, money is short and the bonus points are very attractive to use for travel home or vacation.\nBut getting bonus points is easy, it’s redeeming them for hotel rooms or airline flights that is difficult.That’s because there is no simple comparison tool. Specifically, after getting points from several different hotel groups and airline loyalty programs, in order to get the best deal, the only way I could do is to check EACH official website and compare the price. \nOh my, that is a lot of work. And I am always afraid that there is still something I forgot to compare. Here’s what I mean:\nLast year, I planned a travel in Puerto Rico for one week. My first step was to pick hotels for my stay. I was planning to use my Chase Ultimate rewards points and American Express membership reward points, so I checked out the hotel chains that are their transfer partners. (Chase has partnerships with IHG, Marriott, Ritz-carlton, while Amex is associated with SPG, choice, and Hilton). \nI then compared the points value to limit my out-of-pocket expense, and identified the hotels with reward availability. The problem was the transfer rate within a partnership was different -- with Amex offering a 3:1 transfer rate for SPG while it was 1:1.5 for Hilton.  Checking out all the charts and making notes wasted a lot of my time. Moreover, since Amex offers a great elite program that enables me to book a hotel with perks (i.e. free breakfast, etc.), I needed to check several additional websites to compare deals in order to make a wise decision. TIRING!\nAnd booking hotels was not as crazy buying the airline ticket.\nUsing points to book a round-trip ticket from New York to Puerto Rico was a hassle, even though it is a fairly major route in the states and many airlines offer flights. Again, trying to use my points inventory with Chase and Amex, I found that booking a flight with American Airlines using AAdvantage required 30,000 points while using British Airways Avios only took 20,000 points.\nBut this year, I planned another trip – this time to Japan – using pointimize.com. OMG, it is so easy, relaxing and pleasing! Basically, you should consider pointimize.com as “the kayak” of reward points. \nOnce you go to pointimize.com, let them know what points you have from various credit cards, hotels and airlines. (But you don’t have to remember who their transfer partners are anymore!!) Then plan a trip. You’ll see that the site shows the value of all your points and the cash price on the same page! This is very important because I could decide whether to use points or cash in one click!  You can also check out by map view. \nRemember what I told you in the beginning paragraphs? If you use pointimize.com, it will not happen! Whether it is for hotel or airline tickets, just check pointimize.com. Just like kayak, it will tell you everything you need. My friends, this is a happy story!\nSo, if you want to plan a travel by using points and miles, don’t ask me how to redeem hotel, which one has more value and so on. Just check pointimize, it c','',';;;;Analytics;;;Adtech;;;Indust.

It is based on features and is a product on the market. It is however maintained using web interfaces, does not provide tracking information essential for AR. They offer an enterprise solution using the cloud recognition and all other options are monthly-based plans. Pricing is extraordinary high compared to other solutions investigated. VIZARIO.Find is offline and is superior in terms of latency, the availability of tracking data for AR and pricing options.\n\nhttps://developer.vuforia.com\nVuforia: This is definitely the closest solution available with a clear focus on AR applications. It can recognize around 100 objects on the device in real-time, but it leverages a cloud-based solution for larger datasets. The underlying principle is using natural features, as most frameworks do (including VIZARIO™.Find ). One major issue with Vuforia is the pricing for developers and the restrictions on the monthly data plans and number of recognitions allowed. The managment of databases is done through a web interface, which becomes very tedious with large numbers of images to be recognized. However, it offers superior tracking performance for the targets, as it was designed for that purpose over the last 5 years. Vuforia does also provide a large set of example applications for use with Unity3D. VIZARIO.Find is superior as it autonomously recognizes 100k images and has attractive data plans, providing similar tracking performance.\n\nhttps://moodstocks.com\nMoodstocks: This solution is targeting image recognition on mobiles and is very close to what VIZARIO™.Find does. However, it can only work in real-time for previously cached targets, as it relies on a cloud solution to identify the targets first. It can recognize a large number of targets due to using cloud infrastructure, but all options available are monthly-based plans.

With VIZARIO® all\nmarketing and media materials can be augmented just by pointing a mobile phone on the page\nor TV commercial. Consumers instantly get additional information, insight or even video\ninstructions.\n\nVIZARIO® is an augmented reality platform that allows you to augment virtually all content\nfrom products to printed materials and even longer promotional videos. It was originally\ndeveloped together with corporate clients where speed and identification of large amount of\nobjects is essential.\n\nUnlike other mainstream AR solutions our software kit is using a local database and requires no\nspecial equipment apart from a standard consumer smartphone or tablet. Additionally our\ntechnology works reliably inside buildings even with limited Internet connectivity or in special\nscenarios (e.g. on an airplane). The consumer experience is faster than other mainstream SDKs\nand without the need for additional markers which often is disturbing and confusing to the end\nuser.\nAdditionally VIZARIO® enables a series of further use cases:\n\n• A media publisher needed a solution to make all ads in national advertising\ninteractive. VIZARIO® is his tool of choice as our software is able to augment 100.000\nobjects and more with additional information, coupons, how to videos and more.\n\n• A big leading Video platform has asked us to make feature films and series shop able.\nVIZARIO® can be trained on any printed or video material and delivers additional relevant\ninformation such as what the actors are wearing. In the age of second screening this allows\nfor completely new commercialization scenarios via e-commerce just by point a camera on\nthe mobile phone.\n\n• For a leading supermarket chain VIZARIO® trained an app to recognize all products on\nshelf in their chain without the need to pick up the product and scan the barcode. This\nenables completely new consumer scenarios as the shopping can be made faster and more\nconvenient. E.g. mobile device shoppers can identify all products that are allergy free, on\npromotion, etc. The mainstream AR SDKs on the market today are not able to handle this\nlarge amount of data with reliability and speed.\n\n• A big consumer goods company has asked us to augment their complete product\nportfolio of several thousand articles on any consumer mobile phone. VIZARIO® can be\ntrained to recognize to recognize them and from an existing product information platform\ndisplay augmented information such as how to videos or background info on any consumer\ndevice.\n\n• A global leader in trade shows plans to upgrade his trade fair with an augmented\nreality app. His goal is to point the phone at any of the 40.000 booths and display instantly\nrelevant additional information. For this task VIZARIO was his tool of choice due to\nreliability and speed in object recognition.

Sonicare, Oral-B and Quip for general power toothbrushes.','We have multiple utility and method patents for increasing the safety and effectiveness of a blue-light emitting toothbrush. To achieve clinically significant benefits, the blue light must be sufficiently bright to provide therapeutically effective energy levels over the course of a consumer’s typical 1-2 minute brushing regimen. Since a toothbrush is used in close proximity to the eyes such bright blue light would be uncomfortable at best. Consequently, current commercialized blue light toothbrushes, such as GoSmile, are unable to achieve enough brightness due to the limitations required to ensure eye comfort. Consumers, dentists and regulators will correctly perceive such a product as ineffective and “gimmicky”.\n\nOur invention overcomes this limitation by preventing the user’s eyes from ever being directly exposed to the bright light. Oralucent provides a complete eye comfort safety system because the light only comes on when the brush head is inside the oral cavity or in directly contact with the teeth, and the light shuts off instantly the moment the brush exits the mouth.\n\nWe have developed apparatus and methods including a variety of sensors and software to ensure the user’s eyes are never directly exposed to the bright blue light. Consequently, Oralucent is the only blue light toothbrush able to achieve the clinically significant results seen in studies, within a commercialized product.','Former executive at Sony and IBM.

But there were a few things she missed about Spain.\n\n\nSpecifically, something she used to buy in her local grocery store: boxed cold gazpacho soup. She knew it was a little thing--a small, if very specific, craving. But if every grocery store in Spain had it, and for cheap, why couldn\'t she find it anywhere in the Bay Area? Or why couldn\'t she have it sent to her door?\n\n\nThe entrepreneur did not shrug her shoulders and sigh at the complex tapestry of global economics and international trade infrastructure that created such rich commerce in her new locale. After all, she could readily purchase a hot cup of rare coffee from beans hauled in a dinghy across the Red Sea by a Yemeni kidnapping escapee ($16 from Blue Bottle). Or foie gras ice cream ($3.25 per scoop at Humphry Slocombe). But what good did it do her if she couldn\'t buy a single damn chilled box of gazpacho?\n\n\nShe did not turn away from her problem.

After a few hours we had ingested performed a deep analysis of all the transactions and identified 5 anomalous transactions for their review. We were later told that 4 of the cases were actual fraud and they have tried and can not find them with existing tools, or tools they tried to build. BTW...the 5th case MindBridge identified required further attention that they went of to review. Also worth noting that MindBirdge\'s ability to ingest the data saves anywhere from 10 - 20hrs of an auditors time in preparing the data.\n\nThe news of Wells Fargo is topical these days...here\'s how MindBridge could have detected this....The Wells Fargo scheme was enabled by an internal management-driven pressure to expand the number of customers, resulting in a massive misconduct by over 5K employees. While this represents only 2% of the Wells Fargo workforce, the resulting impact was large and not detected by the Wells Fargo investigative teams due to the limitations of the current technologies to detect unusual patterns of activities over an extended period of time. Most likely resource constraints caused by regulatory reporting requirements, technical skill set limitations and workload also contributed to the problem.\n\nBy leveraging MindBridge’s artificial intelligence algorithms (Control Point insights) on transactional data, the increasing patterns of sales activities in short cycles would have been flagged with a rarity score, and/or outlier detection – applied and detected without the need for the investigator to be a data scientist and understand the algorithms. The MindBridge dashboard provides users with employee activity risk profiles, would have shown an increasing number of employees switching to higher risk profiles from similar anomalous activities, alerting the corporate investigators earlier in the cycle on suspicious new account creation.','Venture backed by Real Ventures (Montreal) and IAF (Toronto)\nAdvisors include Anatol von Hahn (Former Group President Scotiabank), Garry Clement (Executive Director Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists )\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN BOLSTER THE ACCURACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF AML ANALYSTS - Interview & Podcast with Solon Angel: http://www.acfcs.org/news/news.asp?id=308075\n\nRecent interview with Eli Ftahi, CEO, published on the Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/craig-dowden/reflections-from-the-csui_b_12732946.html\n\nRecent speech by Eli at a convocation ceremony: buff.ly/2erff1v ',';;;;Analytics;;;;;;;;;;SaaS;;Cloud;;;;;;;;AI;','https://api.typeform.com/v0/form/rhY03U/fields/32472224/blob/9c2aa58ded6e-MindBridge_Anyltics_Inc..zip?key=5f40d406191360d916f8b3d7f8db46d6cc5206e5',NULL,0,NULL),(171,'12/9/2016 18:13','Frame','Frame helps enterprise IT organizations and independent software vendors (ISVs) create and manage secure, software-defined workspaces in the cloud.

Its flagship product, the Structural Engineering Library, is one of the most widely used tools of its kind in the US.\n\nPC roots\n\nThe Structural Engineering Library began as a set of Lotus 1–2–3 templates for PCs, and has since grown into an extensive Windows structural engineering analysis & design application. ENERCALC includes not just frame analysis, but modules for steel, concrete, timber, masonry, retaining walls and the dozens of other components that go into a real world structural project.\n\nMichael D. Brooks, SE President & Founder of ENERCALC, Inc. said, “Customers love our Windows-based tools, but now need something they can run from any device with no installation. A cloud offering is essential for us as a company because it allows us to offer more flexible alternatives to our standard licensing, including automatic recurring subscriptions.”\n\nInitial online offering\n\nRecognizing their customer’s need, ENERCALC first wrote their own thin client system in 1983. It was a revolution but a little early for the Internet. Then they built their own server farm using what were then the best available tools (Microsoft Remote Desktop Services with dedicated, custom-built servers). This solution provided value to customers and allowed a new type of product offering for ENERCALC. However, managing and maintaining their own infrastructure took time and resources away from their core business.\n\nMeanwhile, an installed launcher EXE was needed as HTML5 was still unproven. This lengthened the user on-boarding experience and required knowledge and support for the customer’s client system.\n\nScaling capacity also required custom management code, load balancing and careful monitoring. Backups, failover and security all had to be handled in-house. Like many innovators, ENERCALC had to do all of the hard work themselves.\n\nMoving to Frame\n\nIn 2016, ENERCALC moved their online customers from their own solution to a new offering built on the Frame platform. Launching ENERCALC SE on Frame for the first time was a simple process of installing the application in the Frame Sandbox and sharing a link with testers. Customizing the platform for the optimum user experience required only moderate code changes and was well supported by Frame features designed with Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) like ENERCALC in mind.\n\nA key advantage for ENERCALC was the ability to easily manage and automatically scale capacity without compromising the end-user experience. Frame scales with consistent performance for each user, whether they are the first or the hundredth concurrent user.\n\nWith Frame, ENERCALC was also able to eliminate the friction of downloads and installs. The Frame client runs in a browser, which removed the need to know the details of the client operating system, or to maintain special clients for different client platforms. Hosting in the cloud provides an attractive SaaS billing model and simplifies the complex job of capacity and resource management. Using the one VM per user design also provides the security and dedicated performance needed for their engineering applications. Most importantly, ENERCALC has built an offering that delights their customers, adds to the bottom line and supports excellence and best practices for U.S. structural and civil engineers.\n\n“Frame has created a new type of publ','Enterprises and ISVs who are looking to implement a cloud-first application strategy to support their employee and customer workflows are Frame\'s best prospects and customers.',';;;;;;;;Edtech;;;;Energy;Infrastructure;SaaS;Enterprise;Cloud;;;;;;;;;PaaS','https://api.typeform.com/v0/form/rhY03U/fields/32472224/blob/2ab46690684c-Frame_Overview_12_9_16_PnP.pdf?key=5f40d406191360d916f8b3d7f8db46d6cc5206e5',NULL,0,NULL),(172,'12/9/2016 20:14','Judefly Inc.','Judefly is  a online travel agency that provides  personalized travel services and accommodations through a deep machine leaning. \n\nJudefly and our deep machine learning chatbot Judy streamline the travel booking cycle.\nProviding personalized accommodations reducing the time it takes to plan and book a trip','Mobility;;;;Mobility;Travel and Hospitality;;;','http://www.judefly.com','','518-596-6100','Travel@judefly.com','646-450-5381','$10,000,$200,000','Pre-seed',';;B2B2C','3-Jan','North Americas','USA, New York','lola, mezi, pana, snaptravel, skyscanner, hipmunk, google, flyr, ','Judy is a deep machine-learning  AI system  tool serving as your personal travel companion and assistant.Judy’s deep learning algorithm takes in account the user\'s personal data, the places a user goes; providing highly personalized recommendations optimized to get the highest satisfaction for each member through a learned Happiness index \n\nJudefly leverages a variety of travel and social API’s to market deals and buy tickets to museums, events, and tourist attractions and add it to a convenient drop list itinerary.

This has a number of potential benefits: decreased drop-out rates, potentially increased sales via online channels, less omissions & wrong answers, lower administrative cost, higher objectivity. \n\nDuring the online application process, customers can connect with popular social media apps & devices. Once granted access, FitSense calculates a proprietary risk score developed in cooperation with Munich Re that predicts the underwriting results based on the customer data for the past 90 days and plays the result back to the insurer in near real-time. If the data profile indicates a low rate of disease incidence, the underwriting form will be significantly reduced. If the data profile indicates a high rate of disease incidence or insufficient data is available, the applicant continues with the traditional underwriting process.\n\nEnriched Underwriting: Mental Health\nMental disorders are different from other major disease groups in medical underwriting, in that there is no biomarker to objectify the state of the applicant. As a consequence, applicants for disability and income protection products with a history of mental disorders are generally declined by most insurers; in fear of anti-selection. In many cases the applicants are perfectly insurable at the point of application and therefore a lost sale – besides the personal dilemma of not being able to purchase coverage. In Germany as many as 22% of the population will suffice a mental condition during their adulthood.\n\nMunich Re and FitSense leverage existing medical research to objectify mental disorders using mobile data. The team has replicated two existing models to discriminate between depressed / healthy individuals and to predict the next depressive episodes for those at risk. \n\nOnce an applicant would normally be declined, the insurer sends a link to the individual with the request to connect with his or her app & device account. Once access is granted, FitSense calculates a depression score of the individual based on the past 180 days. If the result is positive, the applicant can continue to purchase coverage. If the result is negative, the insurer has the option to offer the customer a special product where the customer commits himself to be monitored for early intervention. Munich Re, FitSense and the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich are currently submitting a proposal for a medical study to validate and further develop the depression score.','',';;;;Analytics;;;;;;;;;;;Enterprise;;Digitalization;;;;;;;;','https://api.typeform.com/v0/form/rhY03U/fields/32472224/blob/836ff1dfc94e-FitSense_Pte._Ltd..pdf?key=5f40d406191360d916f8b3d7f8db46d6cc5206e5',NULL,0,NULL),(192,'12/22/2016 19:28','Local Guddy','Localguddy.com is  a travel marketplace which connects travelers and locals through unique local experiences & tours hosted by locals of the city.\nIn 4.5 months, we managed to have +250 tours in more than 25 countries and our average weekly growth rate for the last 12 weeks is 13.89% ',';;;;;Travel and Hospitality;;;','http://www.localguddy.com','','Emre Semercioglu','emre@localguddy.com','9.06E+11','20k TRY','Seed',';B2C;','2 full time + 1 part time + 3 part time interns','Europe','Turkey / Istanbul','We can consider Airbnb\'s experience as competitor','Airbnb\'s experience is so expensive, some of the tours are 3k USD.

','6/8/2016','Markel, Talanx, Thrivent Financial','We have carried out various microinsurance projects (Tumaini ya Jamii) with Jubilee Insurance Kenya through whom we experienced policy distribution and administration challenges in our programs. We went through hurdles of payments reconciliations and claims processing for policyholders. These difficult and time consuming tasks make it expensive for underwriters. Insurance thus becomes very expensive for the mass market due to high margins by the insurers to cover for these costs. Insurance is also a business of trust and it is at claims payment that matters most to policyholders. The rigorous process by traditional insurers is too lengthy and our target market does not receive the value of insurance immediately when needed.\n\nOwing to the challenges on the growth of microinsurance in spite of the intense need, led us to start up GrassRoots Bima which has developed the WazInsure SaaS platform as part of our core solution to manage the entire insurance value chain making it not only transparent but ultimately cheap and cost effective for all insurance stakeholders improving on work flow effectiveness, customer satisfaction and cost savings.','Microinsurance is the protection of low-income people against specific perils in exchange for regular premium payment proportionate to the likelihood and cost of the risks involved.\n\nDifficulty in distribution is one of the most cited reasons for absence of (micro)insurance. The high costs of penetrating informal markets, combined with underutilization of available distribution channels, hinder the growth of insurance services. This adds to costs, both, managerial and financial.  Like inclusive credit, inclusive insurance is expected to be a “low ticket” business, requiring volumes for viability.\n\nTechnological innovation is paramount in handling the back office administration and also in making and receiving payments.

Physicians, on the others hand, are going to receive the useful data to which they have not had access before. This information is going to help treat patients more efficiently. ?	Within the scope of the device itself, one of the main competitive advantages is going to be the sound quality. The stethoscopes available on the market provide sounds that are valid, but differing from those that the physicians hear when using traditional stethoscopes. It makes physician reluctant to use this type of devices. A number of subjective tests carried out with participation of pediatricians confirmed that the auscultation by means of StethoMe™ provides natural sound and physician’s comfort. \n	An important value of the device itself is also going to be the possibility of precise temperature measurement. Market research shows that parents do not trust contactless thermometers available on the market. Our objective is going to providing a device ensuring medical-grade precision of measurements. The sensor applied is identical as in hospital thermometers, which are considered to be among the best ones. Additionally, there was developed a measurement procedure allowing better, quicker and more precise performance of an examination.\n	The wirelessness of the stethoscope head is not only convenient for the user. It also enables obtaining a much better quality of sound. During remote consultation the physician does not perform the examination on their own and the contact with the patient is limited.  Wired stethoscope are very sensitive devices. Even the slightest move results in interference that is problematic when it comes to how sound is received by the physician. Elimination of this interference provides the physician with less distorted data and therefore enables and more precise diagnosis.\n	StethoMe™ is also a device made with very demanding customers in mind. From the very beginning a lot of emphasis was put on the design and quality of execution. There have be no compromises within that field. StethoMe™ is a top shelf device that inspires trust.

We are creating a professional medical device, the task of which is to reform the world of diagnostics and enable professional control over respiratory system condition at patient’s home.

The key membrane attributes which makes this application successful is the highly hydrophilic nature of the membrane. Hydrophilic membranes demonstrate lower fouling than hydrophobic polymer based. When integrated with a diafiltration step, product recoveries of greater than 95% are realized with excellent retention of contaminants. \nIn the second membrane application, a tighter cutoff PicoHelix membrane provides product concentration. The key membrane attributes which makes this application successful is the stable, uniformly tight pore size distribution of the PicoHelix membrane.

Mental Health is one of the top 10 killers in the US, and one of the leading causes of death worldwide too, and one of the drivers for telehealth for the next years, and also for aging population.\n\nUnderstanding mental health triggers, patterns and appropriate responses is critical. Especially because traditional approach treating mental illness is highly inefficient: nearly 2/3 of those affected never seek help from professionals due to stigma attached to mental health, discrimination and thereby neglecting preventive care; Visits to crowded emergency rooms for meltdowns, outbursts or falls; Drugs with side adverse effects and drug abuse contribute to worsening behavioral problems, and sparse therapy without permanent control. These problems require lots of extra efforts from families (on average family with autistic members spend $2.3M in care and monitoring during lifetime; In dementia $287,000 per year) to try to help their loved ones. \n\nMental health also includes aging. The world population of those over 60 will grow from 400M to 1.7B in 2050, with an associated increasing -and costly -need of care. Affective Monitoring will be critical to achieve an increased level of well-being for physical, social, and mental needs by providing adequate protection, security and care as necessary.  Robbie aims to fix a “broken system” as defined by many professionals. \nIn our case, we think that by our trials, we can really provide publication for the first time of clinically validated data that can finally help build affective analytics beyond health, in many other areas! :) \n\n ','Robotics,Wearables,Edtech,SaaS,Indust.

','Alex Baqui is a fourth year MD candidate at McGovern Medical School who is slated to graduate as a physician in May 2017. He conducted most of his medical training in the Texas Medical Center (TMC), the largest medical metropolis in the world. \nAlex led several projects and pursued several other endeavors while in medical school. In 2015, Alex cofounded a New York-based fashion company called Eros & Psyche. In 2016, Alex was casted to compete on the NBC hit TV series \"American Ninja Warrior\" Season 7. \nAlex graduated from Baylor University with a Bachelor of Science (BS) majoring in biology and pre-medicine while dual minoring in chemistry and political science.','2016-04-01','OSF Healthcare, Johnson & Johnson, American National and/or other health insurance affiliate','When my friend and eventual cofounder approached me about Eros & Psyche, I didn\'t know what to think about it at first. As a scientist by trade, I had no fashion experience whatsoever. She came to me with the idea of combining high end fashion with functionality, specifically through a waterproof and stain-resistant skirt. Science? Now that was something I knew plenty about. With that in mind, I accepted the challenge.\nBut I soon found out the science was the easy part; the real challenge came in when I quickly began taking on marketing and operations. As a man who has never worn a skirt in his life, I had to convince women to purchase a product I had no personal connection with, direct a photoshoot and film commercials necessary to translate our value proposition, host local events showcasing our products on live models, and pick fabrics which give the right \"feel\" while remaining economically feasible. No amount of education would\'ve prepared me for these unforeseen demands but nonetheless, I persevered and continued to face the challenges ahead. \nAfter months of arduous work, our moment of truth had arrived. Our Kickstarter campaign managed to sell over 200 units, netting over $20,000 in just two weeks with raving reviews from our customers. Success.\nIn retrospect, I learned a very valuable lesson about myself: that I\'m capable of identifying problems, establishing priorities, educating myself when lacking knowledge, working with those who compliment my weaknesses, and remaining tenacious no matter the task at hand.',' ','Hardware,AI,SaaS,Logistics','',NULL,0,NULL),(619,'03/16/2017 10:08:36','CreditStacks','CreditStacks is bridging the gap prime customers encounter when they enter the credit market, with no credit history.

The former category includes Zephyr BioHarness™ (Medtronics), which as a harness has the advantage that it can be worn across a wide range of sizes.  Most competitors appear to be going in the second direction, integrating sensors into textile or clothing. This latter category includes so-called intelligent textiles, where the garment contains embedded solid state electronics. \n\nExamples of these competitors include, OMSignal’s, QinetiQ, Utopia Compression, Vivonoetrics LifeShirt™, adidas AG, NuMetrex™, Athos, Hexoskin and Healthwatch; and Maxim Integrated (sudden infant death syndrome).\n\nA key difference between the first two categories is that textile or garment based sensors are size specific, while wearable computing sensors (that attach via a strap or electrodes) are not size specific.\nOther companies that are developing textile based sensors include Sensoria, Healthwatch and Heapsylon. \nHeapsylon’s Sensoria sock measures an athlete’s steps and gait. Hexoskin uses piezoresistive technology, which has performance issues and which Footfalls believes is hard to manufacture and Heapsylon itself has stated this.  SmartLife is another textile based solution.\n\n','FHL’s technology can create durable, safe, knitted and washable fabrics that are comfortable and natural to wear, where the textile itself is the sensor, making them ideal for applications requiring contact with the body. The developed textiles are inexpensive to manufacture, as they are able to be manufactured on current knitting machinery and use non-proprietary conductive fibres. FHL believes it can address the critical features that make up a cost effective functional textile. These include a physically flexible sensor, stable signal and connected electronics. FHL has created barriers to competition through the intellectual property protection of its design and manufacturing process.  The Company has filed eight PCT patent applications under family 1 (2 granted in Australia and New Zealand) and four PCT patents under family 2. In addition, there is one provisional patents and one joint PCT application.  These patents describe different aspects of its platform technology, both of which have been published. FHL intends to expand its IP portfolio, through the further filing of application and additional core IP in conjunction with in-licensing of complementary core IP. FHL intends to create a further barrier to competition through the development of a proprietary textile electronics interface and connections.','Simon McMaster is the Founder and Chief Science Officer of Footfalls & Heartbeats (UK) Limited and has many years’ experience in researching smart textile structures and the nanoscale interactions that govern the movement of these micromechanical structures.

Those decisions affect profitability more than pricing. That\'s because scheduled-service providers charter their buses from 3rd parties. That means they can flexibly adjust output to meet demand, as long as they have accurate forecasts in advance.\n\nFurthermore, R&R Analysis only helps with pricing by offering competitive intelligence data; they don\'t do any of the higher level analysis. We\'re currently negotiating an agreement with them that would essentially make them our sub-contractor by allowing them to focus exclusively on data mining. This would allow us to focus on the higher level analysis and would result in us gaining access to their datasets without them gaining access to ours.','We\'ll file for a patent, but our real defensibility strategy is focused on data network effects. It\'s nearly impossible to generate good recommendations for a company if the model is trained on their historical records alone. This is particularly true for companies who don\'t have many years of high quality data or who\'ve never experimented with pricing and scheduling.

They are the market leader in providing sleep treatment in the market, and claim to have achieved exposure to 1 million employees. However, it is not clear how many employees are actually engaged and using their program. SleepRate\'s competitive advantage over Sleepio is 1) SleepRate is more comprehensive (i.e. it also monitors the user\'s sleep using wearable devices); 2) SleepRate gives a more accurate picture of the person\'s sleep by combining both subjective data input (the user fills out a questionnaire, like with Sleepio) as well as objective data input (from the wearable devices, unlike Sleepio); 3) SleepRate is more accessible since the user interacts with the SleepRate solution via an app versus Sleepio whose interaction is primarily via desktop/laptop; and 4) SleepRate is less expensive. All of these advantages have been confirmed and identified as being critical by potential partners with whom SleepRate is in discussions.\nIn addition, there are a number of trackers and apps but they lack the comprehensiveness and accuracy offered by SleepRate, as well as the fact that they don\'t provide actionable information based on the data they gather to explain to the user the significance of their data and what steps to take to improve their sleep situation.\n','SleepRate\'s core technology is patented. But more importantly, it is based on many years of academic and applied research into the connection between heart rate variability and sleep which is at the core of the company\'s legal IP, combined with experience in sleep treatment from a technical/medical perspective, and insight into the sleep treatment market from a commercial perspective. Accordingly, a competitor will require a significant amount of time to close this knowledge gap and then create the sophisticated algorithms that take into account the unique sleep patters of the individual user.','As a company that turns the science of sleep into code, SleepRate is very well positioned with a strong leadership team that both understands sleep in great depth, and knows how to convert this knowledge and experience into algorithms and code. \n Dr. Anda Baharav, CEO, co-founder - Dr. Baharav gained her expertise in sleep medicine as a researcher at the Medical Physics Department at Tel Aviv University, and has more than 20 years working as an Attending Physician at many prestigious medical centers.

','Bay Area','Palo Alto','SP\'s competing solutions were thoroughly analyzed and they seem to fall into two categories, each with their major drawbacks when it comes to DIY wall art: •	Home user devices (e.g. PixelRoller and (spray paint) graffiti printers) – these devices could potentially be commercialized similarly to SprayPrinter (i.e. a DIY smart printing device that anyone can use), but this category has currently no commercially credible solutions (i.e. potential products), but rather consists of one-time experiments carried out by graffiti enthusiasts. The quality of these prints is extremely low and the devices are only able to create very plain prints like words and simple patterns. •	Professional service provider devices (e.g. Opticure, Zeescape and American Mural) – these devices produce high-quality prints and the user can freely choose the picture according to their preference, thus perfectly meeting two of the mentioned criteria (customizability and end result). However, these devices are not available for DIY enthusiasts and home users as these are bulky machines that cost thousands of euros. They thus require a professional printer who takes care of the preparation and printing process. As such, SprayPrinter has no direct competitors on the market today and can enjoy its first mover advantage.','SprayPrinter can boast a competitive advantage in several categories: * Innovative and unique technology - the novel use of Bluetooth, sensors and LED lights in connecting and controlling the mobile app and the printerhead; the use of accelerometers and gyroscopes for an improved accuracy in printing; the state-of-the-art electromagnetic valves that can open and close up to 200 times per second, giving users the freedom to move their hands freely just as with a regular paintbrush; and the unique mobile application. * Endless applications – the technology has numerous applications in various fields, for instance, the customer survey found that clients are interested in using SprayPrinter for vehicles, fabrics and glass. Many new ideas come from the team itself, e.g. a wall robot for completing large (outdoor) murals that is already in the prototype phase, a wideband printer head and the possibility of using several printers simultaneously. * First mover advantage - as the company currently has no direct competition, it is crucial to use SprayPrinter’s first mover advantage, focus on commercialization and sales and not lose its technological leadership.','Richard Murutar, CEO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-murutar-b1368750/\nRichard has previously worked as a CEO at a boat building and nautical development company, which has given him valuable experience in terms of founding an innovative company and carving out a market share of an otherwise traditional field of business.

That leads to a strong competitive advantage: significant reduction of resources and energy consumption, scalability through software updates, easy data transfer, and infinite storage.','','http://hb9697.wix.com/absolute-zero-c','Legacy','','','','','$150K','','','','Copenhagen','','','','','','','','','','',0,NULL),(1304,'','Accedo','Accedo is a provider of interactive apps for smart TVs and connected TV devices for media companies, consumer electronics and TV operators.','','http://www.accedo.tv','Legacy','','','','','$11.27M','','','','Stockholm','','','','','','','','','','',0,NULL),(1305,'','Accent','Accent™ connects you with people from around the world who can translate for free.','Travel and Hospitality','http://accentapp.co','Kevin Wang','','','','','','','','North Americas','','','','','','','','','','','',0,NULL),(1306,'','AcceptEmail','AcceptEmail enables simple & secure electronic billing, dunning, and payment utilizing the power of e-mail or SMS.

Combining offers with gift cards give the consumers and the retailers more value in a much more likely transaction. Revenue is generated from commissions on sales.\n\nThe impact of CardSpur is two-sided. Consumers often leave gift cards unused due to oversight or not being motivated to use the cards. Redeeming the cards for them unlocks the value and fulfills the intent of gift-giving. Retailers need gift cards to be redeemed. Unused gift cards are a liability to retailers. Redemption moves the value of the card from a liability to revenue (and often above the value of the original card purchase).

Providing an email address at purchase is clunky, time-consuming, and does not often provide monetary benefit to the customer.

While our competitors require users to log into a separate website or app and every time they have to self-report some generic green behavior. This is time consuming and ultimately an unrewarding experience for the user - resulting in very low usage rates and therefore a poor return for the client. We on the other hand have a mobile app that sends push notifications to the user based on their past behaviors, their location, and other data points. Our intelligent software works for the user not the other way around. The second major difference is that we provide real local content in our sustainability and social impact challenges, another major improvement for the user experience. Our users get challenged to do things like check-in at a fair trade coffee shop in their neighborhood or sign up for bike share in their city- and our content helps them do it. We know the importance of making the information real, interesting and relevant. This ensures higher engagement levels but also provides the client with much more reliable and compelling data around their company’s collective impact on things like the local sustainable economy, event attendance, and behavior change. \nThe front runner in our space is WeSpire, a Boston-based company that has raised $8M and built a desktop only platform that users rarely engage with because of an unsophisticated approach to the UX from content, to design, to the actual mechanics of how it’s structured.

Pre-launch, the university already had several sustainability initiatives in place: a tray-free dining hall, host of recycling programs, and local produce and campus gardens. MilkCrate for Communities added to these other campus initiatives.\n“A lot of students don’t necessarily know about the resources,” Tim Butler, associate dean of students at Philadelphia University, said. “MilkCrate for Communities provides that and help students make better decisions.”\nThe pilot engaged a subset of the student population and reached 120% of the initial user-engagement goal. The user-friendly app engaged students in social and environmental actions like acting on their civic duties and voting in the 2016 election, signing up for services like CSAs, and opting to bike or walk to class or work, rather than driving. As one grad student said, “MilkCrate is a great way to not only see what you HAVE accomplished and how you are making a difference, but it also gives you new ideas and incentives for further sustainability success.” ','In the last year, 75 percent of the S&P 500 had a CSR report.

His enthusiasm for helping people with disabilities to regain mobility and healthy lifestyle drove him to advance the field of bionic suits. As CEO of Ekso Bionics he commercialized a wearable robot “Ekso,” which enables wheelchair users to stand and walk, an award winning breakthrough that was selected by Time Magazine as the product of the year in 2010.

(We are already talking to people at Lowe’s, Kohl’s, Samsung and Fung Global)','The first live deployment of our technology was at New York Fashion Week this February where we created a VR experience for Samsung. It was the first-ever all-virtual interactive fashion show. Instead of a live show with models walking in front of them, attendees of the show experienced collections of 5 designers through VR headsets. The Oculus app for the Samsung Gear VR included 360 videos of each collection, and an interactive experience where the buyer can see each look in detail from different angles at their own pace, get more information about it and indicate their interest in it. Analytics were collected for all user interactions in VR and the data was made available to the designers after the show. The most common feedback we got after people took off the headset is that this was the “most personal fashion show experience” they had ever had. Here’s the Fortune story about it: http://fortune.com/2017/02/14/samsung-new-york-fashion-week/\n\nWe are currently working with a customer whose VR experience will launch in the summer - they are using \"virtual space\" to extend their \"physical space\". They are a fashion brand launching a home line, but they don’t have space in their stores to set up beds and couches to show off their home products. We are creating a VR experience that they will deploy in their stores in multiple cities across the country, where the shopper who comes into the store will be able to put on a VR headset and visit a beautiful house that shows off their home products. This is an experience you wouldn’t even normally get at a store or online, and it shows their products contextually in-use.','- The file uploader below is not working for us - so here\'s the link to our customer deck: https://www.dropbox.com/s/huduifpiq2r89q5/Obsess%20-%20VR%20shopping%20experiences.pdf?dl=1\n\n- The retail industry is expected to spend $1 Billion this year on researching and developing VR/AR solutions. And this spending is expected to increase to $38 Billion by 2020. [Source: http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42331217] There is a huge opportunity right now for software platforms to come in and help with this development.\n\n- For the next 2-3 years before VR reaches mass consumer adoption, the use cases we are targeting with VR shopping are in-store retail and experiential marketing. We think this is a huge opportunity to create experiential retail as the retail industry struggles with store shutdowns and looks for ways to attract shoppers and engage them.\n\n- We are also now developing technology that we are almost done with, that will let the experiences that we build for VR headsets also be viewed on the web - on mobile and desktop without a headset. The experience won’t be as immersive as being in a VR headset but will extend the reach of the audience that can view them, and it will be a stepping stone to full VR in the future.\n\n- We won a VC-judged startup competition in December at Frontier Tech Forum from among hundreds of startups across Robotics, 3D Printing and VR/AR.\n','FashionTech,E-commerce,VR/AR','',NULL,0,NULL),(5257,'05/06/2017 02:06:40','Hydrao','Hydrao is a French water-tech & data leader in smart solutions for water conservation and management.','IoT,Sustainability ','http://pro.hydrao.com','Tulsi Patel','Eric Burkel','ericb@hydrao.com','+33 6 20 34 66 54','400','Pre-seed','B2B,B2C,B2B2C','10/0','Europe','France, Grenoble','','Two world-wide patents + one pending.
