They also all either require expensive, custom hardware or require the driver to film using their mobile phone which is very restrictive (requires high-end computation hardware for realtime vision analysis)\n\nWe integrate with existing, cheap, off-the-shelf dash cam hardware which costs less than $50. Dash cams are currently one of the fastest growing consumer electronics devices in the world, with more than 15% of cars in the UK (3.5M cars + ) carrying dash cams and more than 14% in Australia. In the USA alone more than 1.5M dashcams were sold in the past 2 years.\nAs our app works in the background when the user starts driving, no user action is required, making the entire process seamless and allows us to easily reach significant scale at a very low cost.","field":{"id":"32472208","type":"long_text"}}]}}
