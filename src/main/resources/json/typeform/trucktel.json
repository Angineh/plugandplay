Working with SONY's SC data, TruckTel located key port locations, with exact capacity to facilitate SONY's movements to the most cost effective extent. Once SONY had approved said locations, TruckTel took the pre-sold (contractually) business/capacity to the chosen land owners and organised options, ready for construction (0 financial risk + guaranteed business/flow for land owner). Following the organisation for the land, TruckTel presented the proposition to SONY's insurance partners. TruckTel was able to achieve a 15% up-front reduction in SONY's annual premium, which covered the cost for SONY to use TruckTel, whilst reducing the theft risk to their insurer.  SONY Tokyo approved the project in January 2017. TruckTel is built on creating a 'win-win' ecosystem for all industry stakeholders. TruckTel only finance the ports once the capacity is pre-sold, creating blue-chip collateral.

We believe there is a vast network of pre-developed locations, that can drastically improve their service/accessibility, through adopting a new standard of infrastructure, powered by technology (digitalisation). TruckTel's vision is to become that provider. We believe that working alongside the traditional markets (truck stops, travel centres etc.), with cooperation (pre-established demand for TruckTel's services) from the industry, there is a fantastic opportunity to revolutionise the way we move road freight. The key is in creating a 'win-win' ecosystem.
