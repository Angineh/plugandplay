Here's why I gave it all up, to build a AI Tech Startup. \n\nI put everything on the line and relinquished a lucrative contracting career, flew 5,000 miles around the world to learn how to build a tech-startup. \n\nAfter partnering with a 3 year old startup, I spent 6 months shadowing the CEO, educating myself from the ground up. Jeez, talk about pressure. Gulp! \n\nAt the time, my peers described me as the quintessential poster child of tech-startups.
