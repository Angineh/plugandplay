This helps consumers better understand complex insurance jargons that they do not come across on a daily basis. Consumers simply take a picture of the summary page of their personal insurance policies. Within 10 seconds, the OCR will successfully digitize each insurance policy. \n\nPolicyPal also offers the platform for small and medium businesses to quote, buy and manage their employee benefits plans online. Our approach is to empower small and medium businesses by eliminating tedious paperwork and simplifying Singapore compliance requirements. By using PolicyPal to manage their employee benefits, both employers and employees can focus less on administration and spend their time on their meaningful work.\n\n","field":{"id":"32472208","type":"long_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"Founded by Val Yap and Yiming Ng in 2016.
