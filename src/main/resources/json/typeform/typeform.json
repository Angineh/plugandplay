That project has been creatively applying RallyEngine for rallying dispersed people and groups, and matching people's capabilities and availabilities with particular tasks and locations. More effectively engaging disparately skilled and variously located people can minimize costly damage and even save lives.","field":{"id":"32474974","type":"long_text"}},{"type":"url","url":"http://www.rallyengine.com","field":{"id":"32472204","type":"website"}},{"type":"email","email":"steve.hardy@rallyengine.com","field":{"id":"32472205","type":"email"}},{"type":"text","text":"RallyEngine is a nimble, mobile-focused resilience platform for alerting groups, rallying people, and enhancing enterprise safety and community capacity.

Our platform is additionally more focused on value added front office innovation (customer experience, proprietary financial products) versus mundane back office tasks (accounting, operations) of competing companies.","field":{"id":"32472208","type":"long_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"Matthew Kane","field":{"id":"32472199","type":"short_text"}},{"type":"email","email":"matt@hedgeable.com","field":{"id":"32472205","type":"email"}},{"type":"file_url","file_url":"https://admin.typeform.com/form/results/file/download/rhY03U/32472224/02136dd62478-Hedgeable.zip","field":{"id":"32472224","type":"file_upload"}},{"type":"text","text":"Fortune 500 banks, insurance companies, and financial services firms use the APIs on our platform to build digital infrastructure, onboarding, UI/UX, digital wealth applications, and AI.","field":{"id":"32474974","type":"long_text"}},{"type":"url","url":"https://www.hedgeable.com","field":{"id":"32472204","type":"website"}},{"type":"text","text":"New York, NY","field":{"id":"32472202","type":"short_text"}},{"type":"choices","choices":{"labels":["UX/UI","Cloud","Analytics","Blockchain","SaaS","AI","Infrastructure","Enterprise","Digitalization"]},"field":{"id":"33005691","type":"multiple_choice"}},{"type":"choice","choice":{"label":"North America"},"field":{"id":"32472211","type":"dropdown"}},{"type":"choices","choices":{"labels":["Fintech"]},"field":{"id":"32472221","type":"multiple_choice"}},{"type":"text","text":"InvestCloud, Sigfig, Accenture, IBM","field":{"id":"32472207","type":"long_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"$2.35 million","field":{"id":"32472201","type":"short_text"}},{"type":"choice","choice":{"label":"Seed"},"field":{"id":"32472210","type":"dropdown"}},{"type":"text","text":"Hedgeable","field":{"id":"32472198","type":"short_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"14 FT. 2 PT","field":{"id":"32474775","type":"short_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"Hedgeable is a front office platform transforming the future of financial services.

Competitors using alternative technologies for quality analysis include Bruker and Foss (spectroscopy), and Clear Labs (genomics). While spectroscopy is more widely accepted having been on the market for longer, HSI has the significant advantage of combining spectral, spatial and chemical information allowing for analysis of heterogenous food products also, resulting in a greater number of applications. Additionally, we are building a platform solution where classification happens remotely in the Cloud, allowing us to serve multiple clients from one software solution, but our competitors are using local classification systems.","field":{"id":"32472208","type":"long_text"}},{"type":"choices","choices":{"labels":["B2B"]},"field":{"id":"32472220","type":"multiple_choice"}},{"type":"text","text":"ImpactVision's mission is to build a more transparent and secure global food system, using hyperspectral technology.

Lumos has the exclusive license to these technologies, which gives us a clear market advantage over our competitors in that our device: 1) is the only one that can be used while sleeping with no disruption to daily activities; and 2) significantly reduces bright light exposure with millisecond pulses rather than continuous light, minimizing the potential for retinal damage and side effects. We also are filing our own provisional patents focused on the form factor, sensor additions, and close-loop models of circadian phase. Finally, our extensive scientific background gives our team a functional advantage when developing, iterating, and testing the technology. Competitors have failed to replicate the 60-70% reduction in jet lag we are able to achieve with our most basic protocol due to having to work around our patents and lack of scientific knowledge.","field":{"id":"32472208","type":"long_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"Lufthansa, Philips, Pfizer","field":{"id":"37990890","type":"short_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"Our team has extensively worked with travelers to validate our technology.

L is a 60+ year old retiree; it takes her several hours to fall asleep, and she only stays asleep for about four hours per night. After using the mask for just two weeks, she wrote: “I have been very pleased at the Lumos Sleep Mask’s ability to make the sleep I get very deep and very refreshing.” After wrapping up our test, L noted: “Since I stopped using the mask, it’s really been the worst of both worlds, with late onset of sleep, followed by frequent periods of wakefulness. [I] would very much like to use it for a longer period of time to see if it could continue improving my sleep.” This is just one example of how our sleep mask can improve sleep and represents an extremely large market.","field":{"id":"32474974","type":"long_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"Lumos was founded by two Stanford female scientists, Dr. Vanessa Burns and Dr. Biquan Luo.

Once SONY had approved said locations, TruckTel took the pre-sold (contractually) business/capacity to the chosen land owners and organised options, ready for construction (0 financial risk + guaranteed business/flow for land owner). Following the organisation for the land, TruckTel presented the proposition to SONY's insurance partners. TruckTel was able to achieve a 15% up-front reduction in SONY's annual premium, which covered the cost for SONY to use TruckTel, whilst reducing the theft risk to their insurer.  SONY Tokyo approved the project in January 2017. TruckTel is built on creating a 'win-win' ecosystem for all industry stakeholders.

As mechanical engineering and computer science are converging. The automotive vertical, is converging with the horizontal industry of computer science. Our first industry alignment user case is with Dyna-Lytics UK an automotive design consultancy. We paired a Mech Engineering PHD with Computer Science at RecruitSumo and the lights came on!

With Airsave Travel, a user who saves with 20 unique friends earns return flights from London to Kuala Lumpur - EVERY four months. There is no other product offering this sort of return.\n\n2) Our model.  Airsave Travel invests a minimum of 50% of profits into our users. 50% of the money we make goes to the savers. This gives every user an incentive to stay with us and to recommend us to their friends. While this ratio could be changed for short term gain, what it offers to us is a long term relationship. \n\n3) Virtual saving.

With Airsave Travel, a user who saves with 20 unique friends earns return flights from London to Kuala Lumpur - EVERY four months. There is no other product offering this sort of return.\n\n2) Our model. Airsave Travel invests a minimum of 50% of profits into our users. 50% of the money we make goes to the savers. This gives every user an incentive to stay with us and to recommend us to their friends. While this ratio could be changed for short term gain, what it offers to us is a long term relationship. \n\n3) Virtual saving. All users are able to track their savings with Airsave Travel for free; using virtual credit until they choose to redeem their savings and earnings.\n","field":{"id":"32472208","type":"long_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"Airsave Travel","field":{"id":"32472198","type":"short_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"Sarah Dales","field":{"id":"32472199","type":"short_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"0","field":{"id":"32474775","type":"short_text"}},{"type":"choices","choices":{"labels":["B2C","B2B2C"]},"field":{"id":"32472220","type":"multiple_choice"}},{"type":"choice","choice":{"label":"Europe"},"field":{"id":"32472211","type":"dropdown"}},{"type":"text","text":"Kevin Wang","field":{"id":"39683158","type":"short_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"London, UK","field":{"id":"32472202","type":"short_text"}},{"type":"text","text":"For nine years Sarah worked as Executive Assistant for the world's top banks - including Goldman Sachs, Barclays Wealth and HSBC.

With Airsave Travel, a user who saves with 20 unique friends earns return flights from London to Kuala Lumpur - EVERY four months. There is no other product offering this sort of return.\n\n2) Our model. Airsave Travel invests a minimum of 50% of profits into our users. 50% of the money we make goes to the savers. This gives every user an incentive to stay with us and to recommend us to their friends. While this ratio could be changed for short term gain, what it offers to us is a long term relationship. \n\n3) Virtual saving. All users are able to track their savings with Airsave Travel for free; using virtual credit until they choose to redeem their savings and earnings.","field":{"id":"32472208","type":"long_text"}},{"type":"choices","choices":{"labels":["B2B2C","B2C"]},"field":{"id":"32472220","type":"multiple_choice"}},{"type":"text","text":"Kevin Wang","field":{"id":"39683158","type":"short_text"}}]}}
